 Quick configuration guide
==========================

|

1. Install the Odoo PrestaShop Connector on your Odoo server – How to install in `Odoo.sh (video) <https://youtu.be/-mToY8rOcCA>`__

    Note that on odoo.sh you will need to add requirements.txt file to the root of your repository with the following content. So additional Python libraries will be installed. On your own instance you will just need to install them manually via pip install command

    | ``git+https://github.com/prestapyt/prestapyt.git@f9898b4245611b487e4592f601a22a07de0a26cc``
    | ``Cerberus==1.3.2``

|

2. Our connector is using queue_job from OCA.  If you are on odoo.sh, skip this section and jump to the next one. Below is quick summary of what you need to add at the end of your odoo.conf file. If you are interested in full documentation, check it out `here <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/queue_job/>`__.

| ``workers = 2 ; set here amount of workers higher than 1``
| ``server_wide_modules = web,queue_job ; add queue_job to server wide modules``
| ``[queue_job]``
| ``channels = root:1``

|

3. Special note for deploying to odoo.sh (`also shown on the video <https://youtu.be/-mToY8rOcCA>`__):

-  Config file can be found when entering shell in the following location "/home/odoo/.config/odoo/odoo.conf". Add there the following configs:

| ``server_wide_modules = web,queue_job``
| ``[queue_job]``
| ``channels = root:1``
| ``scheme = https``
| ``host = <your_odoo_host> (e.g. myhost.odoo.com)``
| ``port = 443``
|
- After changing the configuration file, run ``odoosh-restart`` command in the shell

|

4. Then follow steps from this video to make an initial configuration of our Odoo PrestaShop connector (`video <https://youtu.be/4sop_8WYMWw>`__)
